        <div class="legal-highlight">
            <p><strong>Important Disclosure:</strong> SkyLink Broadband is an independent third-party service assistance provider. We are not affiliated with, authorized by, or endorsed by any internet, cable, or telecom service provider.

        <p>This Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions under which SkyLink Broadband may provide refunds for our service assistance fees. Please read this policy carefully before using our services.</p>

        <h2>1. Refund Eligibility Window</h2>
        <p>SkyLink Broadband offers a refund window of <strong>7 to 15 days</strong> from the date of service for qualifying refund requests. The specific timeframe may vary based on the nature of the services provided and will be communicated at the time of service.</p>

            <li>The issue required intervention from your provider that was outside our control</li>

        <h3>7.1 Refund Method</h3>
        <p>If your refund is approved, it will be issued using the same payment method you used for the original transaction. We cannot issue refunds via different payment methods.</p>

        <h3>7.2 Refund Processing Time</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>The service quality issue was limited in scope</li>
            <li>Other circumstances warrant a partial rather than full refund</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
        <p>If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute with your credit card company or bank without first attempting to resolve the issue with us, we reserve the right to:</p>

            <li>Suspend or terminate your access to our services</li>
            <li>Pursue collection of any amounts owed plus associated fees</li>
            <li>Report the dispute to credit bureaus or fraud prevention services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to contact us directly to resolve any billing concerns before initiating a chargeback.</p>

        <h2>9. Refund Policy Limitations</h2>

        <h3>9.1 One-Time Courtesy Refunds</h3>
        <p>In certain circumstances, we may offer a one-time courtesy refund outside of normal policy guidelines. Such refunds are granted at our sole discretion and do not set a precedent for future requests.</p>

        <h3>9.2 Abuse of Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to deny refunds and suspend services if we detect:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>10. No Guarantee of Service Outcomes</h2>

            <li>Service restoration from your provider</li>
            <li>Specific results or outcomes</li>
            <li>That following our guidance will solve your problem</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lack of successful resolution of your technical issue is not grounds for a refund if we provided the service assistance as described.</p>
